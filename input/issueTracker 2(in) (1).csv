P2,Bug,"Android 16 overhaul, new expressive colors ideas.Hello,As a user, I am excited to discover the future Android user interface, which appears more modern and dynamic, notably with promising new animations.However, I would like to draw your attention to a key aspect of personalization that, in my opinion, could be greatly improved in this new ""expressive"" design: the management of system colors via Material You.Currently, the automatic color extraction based on the wallpaper, while having functional logic (ensuring icon visibility), often results in palettes that do not necessarily match the user's aesthetic preferences. For instance, a wallpaper might generate a pastel color when the user desires a vibrant and bright shade, or produce shades of green deemed unattractive despite the beauty of a nature wallpaper. This lack of control limits the true ""expression"" of the user's personality through the interface.For the ""expressive"" design to genuinely enable richer and more satisfying visual personalization, I suggest the addition of the following features: * Extended Color Palette Control: Offer options to adjust or actively choose system colors, going beyond simple automatic extraction. * Categorized or Adjustable Palettes: Introduce options for palettes based on their visual style (e.g., Vibrant, Muted, Pastel) to allow users to quickly select the desired color mood. * Custom Palette Option: Allow for more precise manual tuning of the hue, saturation, and brightness of the main system colors for users who want fine-grained control. * Save and Load Configurations (Setups): Enable users to save their preferred personalization settings (colors, icon shapes, etc.) to easily switch between different ""looks.""Adding these color customization options and the ability to save configurations would represent a significant step forward for the stock Android interface on Pixel devices, making it more competitive and allowing users to fully express their style.Thank you for considering this feedback.",,Infeasible,0,415494883,"May 27, 2025 07:49PM",,,
